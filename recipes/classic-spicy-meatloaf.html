      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped green onions</li>
      <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 rib celery, finely chipped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>2/3 cup ketchup, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>3/4 pound spicy ground pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/3 cup minced fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, slightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
        onion, green onions, carrot, celery, and garlic until fragrant, about 5
        minutes. Cover skillet with a lid and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        carrot is tender, about 5 more minutes. Stir 1/3 ketchup, Worcestershire
        sauce, salt and pepper into vegetable mixture; cook until warmed
        through, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef, sausage, vegetable mixture, bread crumbs, parsley, and
        eggs in a large bowl; form into a loaf and place in a rectangular baking
        pan with 2-inch high sides. Cover loaf with remaining 1/3 cup ketchup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about
        hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
        at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
