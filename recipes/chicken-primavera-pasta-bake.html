          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Gather all ingredients.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200
              degrees C). Grease a 3-quart rectangular baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring a 4 to 6-quart Dutch oven filled with salted water to a
              boil, and cook pasta until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes,
              adding peas and asparagus for the last 3 minutes of cooking time.
              Drain, reserving 2/3 cup of the pasta water. Hold pasta in the
              stainer; set Dutch oven aside to use for making the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-hight heat.
              Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black
              pepper. Add chicken to hot oil. Cool, stirring occasionally, until
              chicken is golden and fully cocked, 5 to 7 minutes. An
              instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read at
              least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              For sauce, melt butter in the dutch oven. Whisk in flour,
              remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Whisk in
              milk, cream cheese, and chicken broth. Cook and stir over medium
              heat until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 minute more.
              Whisk in reserved pasta water, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, basil and
              oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add pasta mixture to the Dutch oven with sauce; toss to coat. Stir
              in cooked chicken, spinach, and cherry tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon mixture into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining
              1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and topping is
              golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
